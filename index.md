# Park It Right!

## Goal
The focus of this project is to develop an agent that is adept in obstacle avoidance and seamless navigation. The project makes use of a multi-level car navigation game in Unity where a car must navigate through fixed and moving obstacles and park at the highlighted spot. The goal is to train the agent for the two levels of the game in Unity using different machine learning algorithms by tuning different hyperparameters and evaluating the results on the tensorboard.
